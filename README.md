# libft 📚💻

## Overview 📝

`libft` is a C library that implements a variety of functions to handle basic operations such as string manipulation, memory management, and other utilities. This library is a common project in the 42 coding school curriculum, designed to help students build their own version of essential standard C library functions.

## Contents 🧰

This library includes the following categories of functions:

- **String Functions**: Functions for manipulating strings, such as `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strcat`, etc. 💬
- **Memory Functions**: Functions like `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, and others for memory handling. 💾
- **Character Functions**: Functions for handling characters such as `ft_isalpha`, `ft_islower`, `ft_isdigit`, etc. 🔤
- **Conversion Functions**: Functions for converting strings to numbers, like `ft_atoi`, `ft_itoa`. 🔄
- **Utility Functions**: Miscellaneous utility functions like `ft_putchar`, `ft_putstr`, and `ft_lstnew` for working with linked lists. 🛠️

## Functions Implemented 🧑‍💻
